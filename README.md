# LocalZero Monitoring

LocalZero Monitoring is a project that aims to create more transparency for climate protection measures at the municipal level.
It does this by providing a dashboard that shows the climate protection measures adopted by the city council (or comparable institution).
For each measure, the current status, planned timeline, responsible organ and progress is shown in a comprehensible way.

## How to get started
